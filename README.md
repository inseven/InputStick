## Overview

InputStick is a keyboard proxy that lets you control another device with your Mac. The project is based on the [Raytac MDBT50Q-RX](https://www.raytac.com/product/ins.php?index_id=89) and provides custom Arduino-based firmware and a corresponding macOS app. The MDBT50Q-RX plugs into the device you wish to control, and the Mac app forwards whatever you type on your Mac keyboard using Bluetooth.
